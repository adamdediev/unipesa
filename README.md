# Minimal Starter

## What is this?
Minimal Starter is a basic HTML/SCSS/JS starter template using Gulp. All code is held within `app/` and production code is held and served from within `dist/`.

## How to run
Running this starter is as simple as running `npm install` followed by `gulp`. This will process all files in `app/` as needed and open a browser using Browsersync.

## Generating production code
Production code is generated using `gulp production`. This will clean `dist/` and place a fresh copy of your site with no sourcemaps in there.
